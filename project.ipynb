    "### What is Quantum Computing?\n",
    "Quantum computing is a groundbreaking advancement that allows us to solve problems too tough for regular computers. These computers use special methods called quantum algorithms to show their potential. One of the earliest and most notable of these methods is the Deutsch algorithm. It was one of the first to demonstrate the potential advantages of quantum computation over classical methods. While it might not have everyday applications, it's crucial in the quantum world. It shows how these new computers can outperform regular ones and hints at the exciting possibilities ahead.\n",

    "### Explain Quantum Computing\n",
    "Quantum computing offers a novel approach compared to traditional methods. Rather than using bits which are 0 or 1, quantum computers operate with qubits that can be in a superposition of both states. Deutsch's algorithm exemplifies this advantage. It efficiently determines if a function is balanced or constant using just a single quantum query, whereas a classical approach would need two. This quantum efficiency is derived from principles like superposition and entanglement, which allow for advanced computational behaviors. These capabilities underscore the transformative potential of quantum computing.\n",

The outcomes showed that, especially as the complexity of the calculations rose, quantum computing has the potential to handle difficult jobs that classical computers find difficult.\n",

    "### Quantum Gates and the Deutsch Algorithm\n",
    "So we have figured out that Quantum computing operates fundamentally differently than classical computing. Instead of the classical bits, it employs qubits, which are manipulated using quantum gates. Unlike classical gates like AND, OR, and NOT, quantum gates utilize the principles of superposition and entanglement to allow for a richer computational framework. A crucial quantum gate used in many quantum algorithms, including Deutsch's, is the Hadamard gate, denoted as H. This gate can put a qubit in a superposition of both ∣0⟩ and ∣1⟩ states. Combined with other gates such as the phase gate, CNOT, and π/8, we can build a 'universal set' of quantum gates, allowing quantum computers to potentially simulate any physical system and provide new insights into our universe's workings.\n",

    "The Deutsch algorithm specifically utilizes the Hadamard gate to create and manipulate superpositions, aiding in distinguishing between constant and balanced functions in a single query.\n",

    "Deutsch's Algorithm is a important quantum algorithm that showcases the capabilities and power of quantum computing for specific computational tasks. It's designed to figureout what the binary function is $f: \\{0,1\\} \\rightarrow \\{0,1\\}$ with a single query to a quantum oracle. The algorithm can determine whether the given function is the same output for both inputs or different outputs for each input. This can also be said as constant(same) or balanced(different). What is the problem addressed by Deutsch's Algorithm?\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem addressed by Deutsch's Algorithm can be stated as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Given A black-box quantum oracle implementing a function $f: \\{0,1\\} \\rightarrow \\{0,1\\}$ We know this function is guaranteed to be either constant or balanced. A constant function will return the same value either 0 or 1 for both inputs 0 and 1. A balanced function returns opposite values for each input 0 for one input and 1 for the other.  <br>\n",
    "The Objective is to Determine whether the function $f$ is constant or balanced.\n",
    "\n",
    "In classical computing, determining the nature of this function would typically require two queries – one for each input. However, as we have seen with quantum computing we can achieve this with a single query. This shows how quantum computing solves certain problems better than clasical computing. The algorithm operates by mixing two quantum bits into a special quantum state and then applying a specific quantum operation to represent the function. At the end, by measuring these quantum bits, the algorithm figures out if the function always gives the same result or different results for different inputs. <br> <a href=\"https://learning.quantum.ibm.com/course/fundamentals-of-quantum-algorithms/quantum-query-algorithms#deutschs-algorithm\">Deutsch's Algorithm</a>\n",
